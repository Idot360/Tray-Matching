# Tray-Matching 
To use, download the executable file "tray_match.exe" and the database "Lettertray_Combined.csv" to your local drive. Ensure both are in the same directory before running.

To build a new executable file (after editing the source code), navigate to the directory containing the source code "tray_match.py" and the database "Lettertray_Combined.csv" on terminal or command prompt, and run
```
pyinstaller --onefile tray_match.py
```
Move the created executable file found in the created "dist" directory back to the directory containing the database "Lettertray_Combined.csv".
